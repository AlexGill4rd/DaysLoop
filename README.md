# DaysLoop
Always wanted a program that shows you how long you have to stay in front of your desk. Then I welcome you with DaysLoop. A program to know every moment how long you still have to work.

## Handy to have
The program will always stay above any program. This way you can click anywhere but you will still be able to see the timer.

## Restrictions
The application has some limitations. Since it is adjusted to my work times. The clock will always show how long it is until 17:00:00. Then he starts counting back.

### Side node
Do whatever you want with this. Use it yourself. Or customize it. Be free :D
It's also a very small project. It is not difficult to read the code. The program consists of roughly 50 lines of code.

# DaysLoop
Always wanted a program that shows you how long you have to stay in front of your desk. I present you: DaysLoop. A program to know every moment how long you still have to work.

## Handy to have
The program will always stay on top of any program. This way you can click anywhere but you will still be able to see the timer.

## Restrictions
The application has some limitations. Since it is adjusted to my work schedule. The clock will always show how long it is until 17:00:00. When working overtime the clock will change color to show that you are making extra money or just losing too much time xD

## How to use?
#### 1. Download the latest version of the project at releases. (The zipfile at the top)
#### 2. Unzip the file on your computer.
#### 3. If you wish, you can make a shortcut of the DaysLoop.exe file to open it easily.
#### 4. Run the DaysLoop.exe file and you are ready to go.

### Side note
Do whatever you want with this. Use it yourself. Or customize it. Feel free :D
It's also a very small project. The code is pretty straight forward. The program consists of roughly 100 lines of code.

## Photo's
A screenshot of the user interface. On the screenshot you can see how long will need to work until you can leave the office. The blue is an example background. Normally it is transparant :D
